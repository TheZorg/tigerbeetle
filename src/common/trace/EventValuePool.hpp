 * Event value pool template class.
 *
 * This is a specific object pool implementation for our use case: we
 * never want to "free" objects, only allocate them one after the other,
 * and free all the pool memory on destruction or "reset" it on demand
 * (not freeing anything, but effectively restarting allocation from
 * index 0 and resetting the size).
 *
 * The amount of system memory requested is determined using a doubling
 * algorithm; that is, each time more system memory is allocated, the
 * amount of system memory requested is doubled.
 *
 * The returned memory address when getting a new event value space is
 * guaranteed to respect the specified object type alignment.
 *
 * No constructor/destructor are called by this pool.
